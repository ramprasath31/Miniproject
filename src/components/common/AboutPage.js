        <p>
          The idea for SkillSec was born out of a need to create an interactive platform where anyone can learn cybersecurity in a fun and engaging way. Sai Kaushik H, Thenarrasu V, Ram Prasath R, Naveen P, and Saran M, passionate learners and tech enthusiasts, came together to build this platform. We wanted to bridge the gap between theory and practice by giving users the tools to not only learn about cybersecurity but also apply it in real-world scenarios.
